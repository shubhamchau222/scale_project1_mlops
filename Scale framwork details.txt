Code versioning: Github (feature branches strategy)

Infra structure as code: 
(AWS codepipeline, Codebuild, CodeDeploy, EC2, ECR) using IaC tools like, AWS codeFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK)
Maintain auditable infrastructure configuration

Continious Integration (CI):
build test & pakcaging appliction

Containerization: Docker (Images -> ECR publicbase images) 

Continuous Deployment: AWS codedeploy to target env EC2 instances
use appspec.yml file to manage this

Security & permissions: Secret maneger, parameter store to store the environment variables

Ensure the n/w security, firewall activation

Monitoring & logging:

Impliment logging (cloud watch logs, AWS codedeploy logs) for build & Deployment & application runtime

Monitor Deployment and infra using Cloud Watch, metrics, alarams
& Dashboards

Sclability & Reproducibility:

Governance & Complience: DVC, mlflow & model registry version control both data & code


-----------------------------------------------------------
--------------CI/CD pipeline using AWS --------------------

Source Stage: Code change in github triggers the pipeline

Build Stage: 
 	CiodeBuild pull the source code, download model from s3 
 	Docker image built & tested 
 	Image pushed to AMAzon ECR

Deploy Stage: 
	CodeDeplot retrives the artifacts (including appsepec.yml, scripts)
	Lifecycle hooks manage container stop, install & starts
